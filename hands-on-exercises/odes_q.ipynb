    "The `ode.ivp_rkts_range` function uses a Runge-Kutta (R-K) method to solve a first order system of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs).  Use this function to solve the following system of four differential equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "$y'_0 = - y_3 - 2 \\exp(-t)$,  \n",
    "$y'_1 = 2 \\exp(-t) - y_0$,  \n",
    "$y'_2 = - y'_0 - y_2 - y_0$,  \n",
    "$y'_3 = y_0.$  \n",
    "\n",
    "with initial condition $y = (1,0,1,-2)$, and integrating from $t=0$ to $t=1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to `ode.ivp_rkts_range` you will need to use the setup function `ode.ivp_rkts_setup`\n",
    "\n",
    "Solve the system using several different tolerances by adjusting the `tol` parameter in `ode.ivp_rkts_setup`.  Solve the system using several different Runge-Kutta methods by changing the `method` parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "See how the results you obtain increase in accuracy as the tolerance gets smaller.  The analytical solution for $y_0$ is $\\exp(-t) + \\sin(t)$, so you can compare this with the result for $y_0$ obtained with `ode.ivp_rkts_range`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use `ode.ivp_rkts_diag` to return the total number of function evaluations made by the solver.  See how this varies for different Runge-Kutte methods.  Which method is most efficient?\n",
    "\n",
    "To save you some time, here is the callable function you will need to use as an argument to `ode.ivp_rkts_range`."
