    "We consider a situation where a factory can manufacture two different chemicals $A_1$ and $A_2$. The goal for the factory is to determine the quantities $x_1$ and $x_2$ of each chemical to maximize profit under the following circumstances:\n",
    "- a unit of $A_1$ weighs 40kg and a unit of $A_2$ weighs 80kg;\n",
    "- the total daily production cannot exceed 16000kg to match the transport capabilities;\n",
    "- the factory generates \\\\$2 profit for each unit of $A_1$ and \\\\$4.5 profit for each unit of $A_2$;\n",
    "- both products need to use the same machine as part of their respective processes; a unit of A1 requires 1.2 minutes of machine time while a unit of $A_2$ requires 3 minutes; the machine can only function for 1500 minutes daily;\n",
    "- a unit of $A_1$ uses 6 square metres of packing material while a unit of $A_2$ uses 10 square metres; 6000 square metres of packing materials are available each day;\n",
    "- production of $A_2$ is limited to 100 units per day.\n",
